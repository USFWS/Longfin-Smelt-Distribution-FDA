# Longfin-Smelt-Distribution-FDA

## Overview
This repository contains code and data to support a manuscript titled "Decoupling abundance and timing of presence to characterize distributional patterns of longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) in the San Franscisco Estuary."

The code reads and processes counts of Longfin Smelt from the San Francisco Bay Study monitoring program (https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Bay-Study) to produce functional data that describes the probability of observing Longfin Smelt in five regions of the San Francisco Estuary. It then uses a functional data analysis approach to describe expected patterns in Longfin Smelt distribution. It also parses the variation around the expected patterns into two sources of variation: amplitude variation (vertical deformations of the curves) and phase variation (horizontal deformation of the curves, after amplitude variation has been accounted for). An additional script reads the Fall Midwater Trawl monitoring data (https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Fall-Midwater-Trawl) and produces graphs.

## Installation
Program R and various packages are required to run this code. The file structure is set up as an RStudio project, but RStudio is not necessary to run the code. Both R and RStudio are free, open source programs.

## Contribute
The main purpose of this repository is to share the code for a published paper. Please contact the project maintainer for information about this repository or about collaborating on future work.
